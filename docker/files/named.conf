// Copy this file to /etc/bind/named.conf if you want to run bind as an
// authoritative nameserver. If you want to run a recursive DNS resolver
// instead, see /etc/bind/named.conf.recursive.
//
// BIND supports using the same daemon as both authoritative nameserver and
// recursive resolver; it supports this because it is the oldest and original
// nameserver and so was designed before it was realized that combining these
// functions is inadvisable.
//
// In actual fact, combining these functions is a very bad idea. It is thus
// recommended that you run a given instance of BIND as either an authoritative
// nameserver or recursive resolver, not both. The example configuration herein
// provides a secure starting point for running an authoritative nameserver.

options {
	directory "/var/bind";

	// Configure the IPs to listen on here.
	listen-on { any; };
	listen-on-v6 { none; };

	// If you want to allow only specific hosts to use the DNS server:
	//allow-query {
	//	127.0.0.1;
	//};

	// Specify a list of IPs/masks to allow zone transfers to here.
	//
	// You can override this on a per-zone basis by specifying this inside a zone
	// block.
	//
	// Warning: Removing this block will cause BIND to revert to its default
	//          behaviour of allowing zone transfers to any host (!).

// Example of how to configure a zone for which this server is the master:
//zone "example.com" IN {
//	type master;
//	file "/etc/bind/master/example.com";
//};

// You can include files:
//include "/etc/bind/example.conf";
include "/etc/bind/conf/domain.conf";
